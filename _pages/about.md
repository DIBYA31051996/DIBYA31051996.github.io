I am a Senior Research Fellow (SRF) at [Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)](https://aries.res.in/), Nainital, Uttarakhand, India. My research area is solar astrophysics. I mostly study the long-term phenomena in the Sun using archival ground-based data like [Kodaikanal Solar Observatory](https://kso.iiap.res.in/new) and space-based data.
